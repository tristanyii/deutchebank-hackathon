## Features

- **U.S. Resource Matching**: Provides LIHEAP, Housing Resources, and Unclaimed Benefits Finder
- **Voice-Optimized Responses**: Natural speech formatting at 1.3x speed
- **Urgent Situation Handling**: Empathetic responses for shutoffs/evictions

## Endpoints

### Main Webhook Endpoint
- **POST** `/retell/webhook` - Primary webhook for Retell AI events
- **POST** `/retell/events` - Alternative webhook endpoint

### Utility Endpoints
- **GET** `/health` - Health check endpoint

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd flask_backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   Make sure your `.env` file in the parent directory contains:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   SERP_API_KEY=your_serp_api_key
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   python run_server.py
   ```

## Retell AI Configuration

Configure your Retell AI webhook to point to:
```
https://your-domain.com/retell/webhook
```

## How It Works

1. **Voice Input**: User speaks during a Retell AI call
2. **Transcription**: Retell AI sends transcribed text to the webhook
3. **Anthony Processing**: The Flask backend processes the text with Anthony persona
4. **Conversation Flow**: Anthony collects user info step-by-step (need, location, name, age, income)
5. **Resource Matching**: Anthony provides U.S. resources (LIHEAP, Housing, Benefits Finder)
6. **Voice Response**: The response is formatted for natural speech and sent back to Retell AI
7. **Voice Output**: Retell AI converts the response to speech for the user
